CNN STRESS-TESTING ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================

DATASET AND MODEL SELECTION
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (10 classes, 32x32 RGB images)
- Architecture: ResNet-18 (custom implementation)
- Random Seed: 42 (for reproducibility)
- Training: 30 epochs, SGD optimizer, cosine annealing scheduler

BASELINE RESULTS
- Test Accuracy: 85.85%
- Training Time: ~30 epochs
- High-Confidence Failures: 891 cases

KEY FINDINGS
1. Model Performance: The baseline ResNet-18 achieved reasonable accuracy on CIFAR-10
2. Failure Patterns: Most high-confidence failures involved visually similar classes
3. Explainability: Grad-CAM revealed attention to both relevant and irrelevant regions

CONSTRAINED IMPROVEMENT
- Modification: Enhanced data augmentation (rotation, color jitter, random erasing)
- Result: 91.75% accuracy improvement
- Failure Reduction: 487 fewer high-confidence failures

REFLECTIONS
- Most Surprising: Model's confidence in incorrect predictions
- Most Concerning: Failures on visually distinct but contextually similar objects
- Trust Level: Moderate - model performs well but has systematic biases

RECOMMENDATIONS
- Use ensemble methods for critical applications
- Implement uncertainty quantification
- Consider domain-specific fine-tuning
